  ### Pie charts
  This is a PIE chart for qualitative data analysis. The chart on the left side of the image shows detailed percentages of fuel type for each category given in the dataset. Our project offers 7 types of qualitative data to be analyzed as a PIE chart. The right side is interpreting the chart results.

  ### Regression Modeling
  This image shows the regression modeling of the predicted model year vs price. The stats are visible to estimate the price with respect to the model year of the car. Our project can also predict a regression model for milage vs price.

  ### EDA
  The left side of this image shows a box plot of kms_driven by cars in the given dataset. While the right side shows and interprets the statistics such as min, max, range, quartiles, mode, IQR, variance, and standard deviations. Our project can provide EDA for 7 different quantitative data, given in the dataset, to be analyzed and interpreted.

  ### Regression modelling prediction
  The highlighted box allows to search for the confidence interval for the price of a 50,000 km-driven car. The left side shows the predicted price in lakhs, the prediction interval, and tells whether the test is accepted or not.
